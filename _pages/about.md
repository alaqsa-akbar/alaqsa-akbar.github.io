## About Me
I'm Alaqsa Akbar, a dedicated and ambitious junior in computer engineering with a focus on artificial intelligence. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve been deeply involved in AI research, exploring innovative approaches in areas such as adversarial training, AI for climate action, and image segmentation techniques inspired by human perception.

My most recent work focuses on enhancing the robustness of adversarial patches in rainy conditions, a project I plan to publish soon. I’ve also completed specialized AI training through the KAUST Academy, which included courses from Oxford University on NLP and deep unsupervised learning having been chosen amongst 15 out of 7000+ students from the kingdom, further honing my expertise in the field. I aim to participate in KFUPM's research concentration for my senior year.

Beyond research, I am passionate about applying my knowledge to real-world challenges and create a noticable impact on the world. I aim to continue my studies in AI, with aspirations for a Master’s degree and possibly a Ph.D., where I can contribute to impactful, disruptive technologies.
