## About Me
I'm Alaqsa Akbar, a dedicated and ambitious computer engineering student at KFUPM, specializing in artificial intelligence through a research concentration. My journey has taken me across leading institutions and projects—from an exchange term at Georgia Tech to advanced AI coursework at Oxford University, where I was selected among 15 students out of 7000+ applicants.

My research interests span machine learning, with a focus on the intersection between Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recently, I’ve worked on RainPGD—a project investigating rain-robust adversarial patch attacks—and contributed to BreachSeek, a multi-agent automated penetration testing framework. At Georgia Tech’s OLIVES Lab, I supported AI research in medical imaging and seismic data, while at the SDAIA-KFUPM Joint Research Center for AI, I developed robust adversarial attack pipelines.

Currently, I’m interning at Baker Hughes, where I develop machine learning models for abnormality detection and contribute to embedded systems automation. Beyond technical work, I was honored to be selected for the prestigious Qimam Fellowship, chosen among 50 students from over 18,000 applicants—a program that cultivates leadership and innovation. I also participate in the BCG Jeel Tamooh Fellowship, further broadening my exposure to industry impact.

Driven by a passion to apply AI for real-world challenges, I plan to continue my studies through a Master’s degree and potentially a Ph.D., with the aim of designing technologies that create meaningful, disruptive impact.
